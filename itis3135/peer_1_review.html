                    <p>CRAP Principles</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contrast: The light blue stands out really well from the yellow background. The text also stands out well and is easy to read.</li>
                            <li>Repitition: The theme of the clients website stays true throughout and every page is well designed.</li>
                            <li>Alignment: Mostly goood. All the content is aligned well. However, the nav bar on the left is not alinged with the content can looks a little off.</li>
                            <li>Proximity: The spacing of all the content looks good. However, the nav bar doesn't have a good proximity. Its tiny and push off the left.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>The Good</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Colors are pleasing to look at</li>
                            <li>Well built and organized website</li>
                            <li>Interactive elements such as slide shows</li>
                        </ul>
                    <p>What needs work</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The nav bar</li>
                            <li><strong>Possible suggestion:</strong> Make the nav bar bigger so on the smaller pages that do not schroll, it'll look more aligned with the content.</li>
