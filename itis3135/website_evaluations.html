            <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

            <h3>Bad Website: <a href = "https://www.art.yale.edu/">www.art.yale.edu</a></h3>
            
            <p class = "pad-left">The Yale School of Art website, I believe is designed to look bad. Upon entering the site, you are bombarded with conflicting colors and illegible text.</p>
            <p class = "pad-left">This website goes against the crap principles of design is these ways:</p>
            <ul class = "ulextrapad">
                <li>The contrast throught the sight is a awful. The dark dackround of the site is littered with white boxes of black text</li>
                <li>Repetition is non existant in this website</li>
                <li>Everything in this website is left aligned leaving the majority of the screen empty.</li>
                <li>Proximity of the imformation in this site is semingly random, with ramdom boxes of information placed all over.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Good Website: <a href = "https://www.google.com">www.google.com</a></h3>
            
            <p class = "pad-left">Google's website has a very nice and efficent design. It's not filled with useless information and the search bar is right in the center. For an added bonus, there is a dark mode. </p>
            <p class = "pad-left">This website uses the crap principles of design in these ways:</p>
            <ul class = "ulextrapad">
                <li>The contrast in the website is great. Dark backround with white text and searchbar.</li>
                <li>Google and searchbar remain at top of screen when using google search engine.</li>
                <li>The alignment of this website is well done and pleasing to look at. Google is centered on the main page and left aligned on search results.</li>
                <li>Proximity of information is also nicely done. Gmail and other Google software is kept nicley in the top right corner.</li>
            </ul>
